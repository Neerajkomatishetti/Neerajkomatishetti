## About Me

I'm a computer science student who is really into technology and innovation. I've learned a good amount about coding in Java and Python, and I love figuring out tricky problems. I'm always looking to learn new things and come up with fresh ideas. I'm searching for an internship to gain real-world experience and understand how companies work. I'm eager to pick up new skills and grow in my field. I'm confident I can be a valuable asset to any team and will work hard to deliver great results.
